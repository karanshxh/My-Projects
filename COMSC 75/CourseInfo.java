/*
 * You are given a file named courselist.dat that contains
 * data about school courses in this format:
 * 
 * ACCTG:Beginning Accounting:20
 * COMSC:Java Programming:49
 * COMSC:C++ Programming:55
 * 
 * where each line consists of a subject name, course title, and 
 * number of hours of instruction, separated by colons.
 * 
 * This program will read the course data in to an ArrayList. If there is
 * bad data in the file, the program reports it.
 * 
 * After the data is read, the program will then repeatedly prompt
 * the user for a subject name. If the ArrayList contains
 * courses with the subject name, the program will:
 * 
 * 1) Print the total number of courses in that subject
 * 2) Print the average number of hours of instruction in that subject
 * 3) Write a file with the name of the subject as part of the file name.
 *    This file will contain the course information for the courses in
 *    that subject.
 * 
 * Here is a sample run of the program.
 * ======================================
Reading course file...
"SHORT:not enough entries" does not have three entries.
"LONG:too many entries:55:79" does not have three entries.
"BAD:Non-number on line:twelve" does not have a number on it.

Enter a subject name, or press ENTER to quit: ECON
